# Railway Reservation System Database

## Description 

You are hired by a Railway Company, you are asked to design a system which provides
information to passengers about the trains available on the bases of source and destination, other
information like status of the train, status of passenger ticket, how many seats are available etc.
Suppose you are given the following requirements for a simple database for the Railway
Reservation System:

This system helps to maintain the records of different trains, the trainâ€™s status, and passengers.
* Each Train has Train number, train name, source, destination, fair of Premium Ticket,
fair for general ticket and weekdays on which train is available.
* Train status includes date information for which the ticket was booked, total number of
seats available and number of seats already occupied.
* Passenger has name, age, address of the passenger, status of reservation (if confirmed or
waitlist), category of the ticket booked.


**Note: As the system is very large and is not feasible to develop therefore there are some
assumptions that need to be considered, for example:**
* Only two categories of tickets are available : Premium and General Ticket
* The total number of tickets can be booked in each category (Premium and General) is 10
* Number of tickets in waiting is 2
* Total Number of trains are 5
* Any stops made by a train before its final destination and their bookings are not considered.
